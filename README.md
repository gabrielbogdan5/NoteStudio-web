## ✦ Getting Started

### Option 1 — GitHub Pages (recommended)

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**
3. Set source to `main` branch → `/ (root)`
4. Visit `https://gabrielbogdan5.github.io/NoteStudio/`

### Option 2 — Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrielbogdan5/NoteStudio.git
cd NoteStudio

# Any static server works, e.g.:
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

### Option 3 — Just open the file

Download `index.html` and open it directly in any modern browser. Service Worker and PWA features require a server, but the core app works offline either way.

## ✦ Folder & Tag System

NoteStudio supports a full organizational system:

- **Folders** — visible in the sidebar. Create with **＋**, rename with ✏️, delete with 🗑. A note can belong to multiple folders.
- **Tags** — add free-form tags to notes via the 🏷 button in the editor titlebar.
- **Filter** — click any folder or filter chip (All / Pinned / Trash) to instantly filter the note list.

---

## ✦ PWA & Offline Support

NoteStudio uses a **three-strategy Service Worker**:

- **Cache-First** — app shell (HTML, icons, manifest) served instantly from cache
- **Stale-While-Revalidate** — Google Fonts and CDN assets updated silently in background
- **Network-First** — all other requests, with cache fallback when offline
- **AdMob bypass** — ad network requests are never intercepted (required for ads to work correctly)

After the first visit, the app works **fully offline**.
